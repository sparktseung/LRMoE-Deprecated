# Overview

**LRMoE** is a statistical software tailor-made for actuarial applications which allows actuarial researchers and practitioners to model and analyze insurance loss frequencies and severities using the Logit-weighted Reduced Mixture-of-Experts (LRMoE) model.

**LRMoE** offers several new distinctive features which are motivated by various actuarial applications and mostly cannot be achieved using existing packages for mixture models. Key features include:
* A wider coverage on frequency and severity distributions and their zero inflation;
* The flexibility to vary classes of distributions across components;
* Parameter estimation under data censoring and truncation;
* A collection of insurance rate making and reserving functions; and
* Model selection and visualization tools.
